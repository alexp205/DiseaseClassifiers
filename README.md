# DiseaseClassifiers
A small collection of classification and regression decision tree and random forest-based projects designed for practice and exploration of machine learning.

The over-arching project is split into a few general components:
1. Decision Tree Classifiers - a decision tree is trained on heart disease data and must predict the "likelihood" of heart disease in the patient
2. Decision Tree Regression - similar to 1, but now a different, continuous value is being predicted
3. Random Forest Classifiers - a look into how random forests work in general as well as in relation to decision trees, this specific application focuses on classification
4. Random Forest Regression - similar to 3, but with regard to regression

## Data Information
The dataset was pulled from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). Specifically, the heart disease dataset (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) was used due to the amount of available data, the variety of data types, and its applicability.

The specific details for each project are as follows:

## Structure Notes
A few notes on the chosen structure:
 - the splitting algorithm used at nodes calculates entropy and maximum information gain
