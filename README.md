# DiseaseClassifiers
A small collection of classification decision tree-based projects designed for practice and exploration of machine learning.

The over-arching project is split into three general concepts:
1. Discrete Classifiers - a decision tree is trained on a list of symptoms and must choose between two potential diseases
2. Discrete Multiclass Classifiers - similar to 1. but now a greater list of potential diseases is available and possible
3. Continuous Classifiers - a list of symptoms (and necessary values) is provided and the decision tree must decide the likelihood of a certain disease
